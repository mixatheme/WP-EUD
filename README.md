# WP-EUD

WP-EUD is an [Ethical Use Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Developers to package with [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses) distributed themes, plugins, projects or source code. WP-EUD, in its simplest form, is a text document: [`ETHICS.md`](https://github.com/mixatheme/WP-EUD/blob/master/ETHICS.md). WP-EUD, as a mission, is to assist the WordPress Community by pledging to abide by ethical standards when publishing GPL-compatible software to the public.

**What are ethics?**

>**Ethics** ( /eTHiks/ ) or moral philosophy is the branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term ethics derives from the Ancient Greek word ἠθικός ethikos, which is derived from the word ἦθος ethos (habit, "custom"). The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values. —[WikiPedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)

## Limitations

* :warning: WP-EUD is not for everyone. If any part of your project is not GPL-compatible or you simply don't agree to any pledges we've committed, then please do not package WP-EUD into your distribution.

* :warning: WP-EUD is not a legally binding document.

* :warning: WP-EUD is intended to be a single-page text document with a very specific list of pledges compiled by the community. It is not intended to become a bloated book or an unlimited list of rants.

* :warning: WP-EUD is free and open-source. No commercial monetizing will ever be requested by this project. Therefore, we've opted to not purchase a domain name or hosting because those cost money. If you discover any entity claiming to be affiliated with WP-EUD please report them to us.

* :warning: WP-EUD is opt-in for pledges. In no way do these policies have to be enforced by any Developer or any End User who chooses not to use WP-EUD. 

* :warning: WP-EUD is intended for, but not limited to, software built for WordPress.

# WP Wireframe Ethics

WP Wireframe Ethics is an [Ethical Use Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Developers to package with [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses) distributed themes, plugins, projects or source code. WP Wireframe Ethics, in its simplest form, is a text document: [`ETHICS.md`](https://github.com/mixatheme/wp-wireframe-ethics/blob/master/ETHICS.md). WP Wireframe Ethics, as a mission, is to assist the WordPress Community by pledging to abide by ethical standards when publishing GPL-compatible software to the public.

**What are ethics?**

>**Ethics** ( /eTHiks/ ) or moral philosophy is the branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term ethics derives from the Ancient Greek word ἠθικός ethikos, which is derived from the word ἦθος ethos (habit, "custom"). The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values. —[WikiPedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)
